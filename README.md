## Introduction

This repository serves as an example project for developers looking to implement a solution for storing and retrieving entity data in AWS. The primary focus is on using OpenSearch for search capabilities, but we also utilize various AWS services to create a robust and scalable architecture.

## Technologies Used

The following AWS services and technologies are used in this project:

- **AWS API Gateway**: To create and manage APIs.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: For infrastructure as code.
- **AWS IAM**: To manage access and permissions.
- **AWS Lambda**: To run backend code without managing servers.
- **AWS OpenSearch**: For search and analytics.
- **AWS S3**: For storing data.
- **AWS SAM**: For serverless application management.
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: To manage sensitive information.
- **AWS SNS**: For messaging.
- **AWS SQS**: For queuing.
- **Python**: As the primary programming language.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monkthemonker/aws-entity-data-consultation.git
   cd aws-entity-data-consultation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up AWS credentials**:
   Make sure you have your AWS credentials configured. You can do this using the AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```

```

- **README.md**: This file.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.
- **template.yaml**: CloudFormation template for deployment.
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the Lambda functions.
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the code.

## How to Use

To use this project, you can deploy the Lambda functions and APIs provided in the code. Here's how:

1. **Deploy the application**:
   Use AWS SAM to deploy:
   ```bash
   sam build
   sam deploy --guided
   ```

2. **Access the API**:
   After deployment, you will receive an API endpoint. You can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API.

3. **Store Entity Data**:
   You can send a POST request to the API to store entity data.

4. **Retrieve Entity Data**:
   Use a GET request to fetch stored data.

## Deployment

This project uses AWS CloudFormation for deployment. The `template.yaml` file defines the resources needed for the application. You can modify this file to customize your deployment.

### Steps for Deployment

1. **Build the application**:
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   sam build
   ```

2. **Deploy the application**:
   Use the guided deployment option:
   ```bash
   sam deploy --guided
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   Provide the necessary information, such as stack name and region.

4. **Check your AWS Console**:
   After deployment, check the AWS Console for your resources.
